//TASK 5: declare in variable for position and normal to recieve from vertex shader

//TASK 10: declare a vec4 out named fragColor

//TASK 12: declare a uniform to store the ambient coeffient

//TASK 15: declare a uniform to store the light position


void main() {
    //TASK 10: set fragColor to vec4(1.0) and make sure you can see the white circle.

    //TASK 11: set fragColor to have color components from the normal vector to make sure the normals are transformed correctly.
    //         once you verify that the normals are correct set the frag color to black to prep for the next part of the lab

    //TASK 14: add a vec3 with components given by the ambient coefficient to the output color

    //TASK 17: calculate the direction vector to the light

    //TASK 18: using kd, the normal, and the direction vector to the light, compute the diffuse intensity

    //TASK 19: add the diffuse intensity to the final color

    //TASK 20: compute the light vector reflected about the surface normal

    //TASK 21: compute the direction vector to the camera

    //TASK 22: using ks, the reflected light vector, and the camera direction vector, compute the specular intensity

    //TASK 23: add the specular intensity to the final color
